<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intensive Care Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intensive Care Neonatal Ventilators market comprises two primary types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators are mechanical devices that deliver oxygen directly into the lungs through an endotracheal tube, providing critical support for severely ill neonates. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, use methods such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) to assist breathing without requiring intubation, making them suitable for less critical cases and promoting comfort and safety in fragile infants.</p></p>
