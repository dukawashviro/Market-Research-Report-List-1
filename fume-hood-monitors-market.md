<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fume Hood Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ducted Fume Hoods</li><li>Ductless Fume Hoods</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fume hood monitors market is primarily divided into two types: ducted and ductless fume hoods. Ducted fume hoods are connected to a building's ventilation system, effectively exhausting hazardous fumes and maintaining air quality. They are commonly used in laboratories with high levels of toxic substances. In contrast, ductless fume hoods recirculate air using integrated filters to remove contaminants, making them ideal for spaces where installation of ductwork is impractical. Both types ensure safety in environments handling volatile materials.</p></p>
