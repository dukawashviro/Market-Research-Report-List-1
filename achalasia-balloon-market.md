<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Achalasia Balloon Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li> Pneumatic</li><li>Standard </li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Achalasia Balloon market is primarily divided into two types: pneumatic and standard balloons. Pneumatic balloons are designed for dilation procedures to relieve esophageal blockage caused by achalasia, utilizing air pressure to expand. Standard balloons, on the other hand, are typically pre-filled and maintain a consistent diameter during the dilation process. Both types serve to improve patient quality of life by alleviating symptoms, but they differ in their mechanisms and applications in treating esophageal conditions.</p></p>
