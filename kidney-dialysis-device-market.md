<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Kidney Dialysis Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis (HD)</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The kidney dialysis device market primarily comprises two types: Hemodialysis (HD) and Peritoneal Dialysis (PD). Hemodialysis involves the use of a machine to filter blood through an artificial kidney, typically performed in clinical settings. In contrast, Peritoneal Dialysis utilizes the patientâ€™s own peritoneal membrane for filtering blood, allowing for home-based treatment. Both methods enable patients with kidney failure to manage their condition effectively, ensuring the removal of waste products and excess fluid from the body.</p></p>
