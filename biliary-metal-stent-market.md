<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biliary Metal Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Covered Version</li><li>Non-Covered Version</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biliary metal stent market is categorized into covered and non-covered versions. Covered biliary stents feature a protective layer that reduces the risk of tissue ingrowth and occlusion, enhancing patency duration. They are often used in complex cases where prolonged drainage is needed. In contrast, non-covered biliary stents lack this covering, making them more prone to blockage but usually easier to remove. Each type serves distinct clinical needs, depending on factors like patient condition and treatment goals.</p></p>
